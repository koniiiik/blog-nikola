So I decided to give blogging another shot after a few years of slacking
off. The old site where I used to dump my brain has rotten since I last
used it so here's another attempt, this time using a static site
generator, which should be less error-prone.

I've been feeling the urge to blog about stuff lately so we'll see how
long it takes me to give up again.

At first I tried to use Blogofile_, however, after discovering it doesn't
really have a working mechanism to manage images and in addition its way
of extracting lead paragraphs for the index rather sucks (it only has a
limit on the number of words, so it is very likely it will cut the article
in the middle of a sentence instead of letting the user specify a cutting
point) and there were a few other things I didn't like about it (such as
Mako templates or lack of development), I tried to look for alternatives.

I almost settled on Octopress_, which looks rather nice, however, it is
written in Ruby whose syntax makes me want to engage in an involuntary
personal protein spill and has no built-in support for ReST (which is what
I want to write my posts in). Luckily, before I got too much of
configuration in place, I found out about Nikola_ which seems to be just
the thing for me. It supports ReST, Jinja, better handling of metadata
and, of course, is written in Python. On the other hand, it does not
generate a nested directory structure of posts from a simple flat dump of
files, though this might not necessarily be a bad thing, in case the
number of posts grows -- in that case it might be beneficial to have the
sources already sorted into monthly categories. I'll probably submit a
patch for a configuration option for the file name of a new post upstream.
